# `todozi search`

Perform a keywordâ€‘based search for tasks.
The command scans the textual content of every stored task and returns those that match the given query string.

## Usage

```sh
todozi search tasks <QUERY>
```

- `<QUERY>` â€“ Any string you want to look for (e.g., `"authentication"`, `"refactor"`).

## What you get

A table with the matching tasks, showing at least the following columns:

| ID | Action | Project | Tags | Status | Priority |
|----|--------|---------|------|--------|----------|

If no tasks match, the command prints:

```
ðŸ“­ No tasks found for query "<QUERY>"
```

## How it works

1. **Load tasks** â€“ All task files under `~/.todozi/tasks/â€¦` are read into memory.
2. **Simple filter** â€“ The query string is lowerâ€‘cased and compared against the concatenated fields `action`, `context`, `tags`, and `project`.
3. **Result formatting** â€“ Matching tasks are sorted by creation date (newest first) and displayed using the `tabled` crate.

## When to use `search`

- Quickly locate a task when you only remember a fragment of its description.
- Find all tasks that reference a particular library, endpoint, or code concept.
- Combine with other CLI tools (e.g., pipe the IDs to `todozi show`).

## Related commands

- `todozi list tasks` â€“ List tasks with structured filters (project, priority, etc.).
- `todozi search-all` â€“ Run a semantic (embeddingâ€‘based) search across tasks, memories, ideas, and more.
- `todozi find` â€“ Unified search that mixes keyword and AIâ€‘driven semantic results.
